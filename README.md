# Cardboard Quality Control System

A comprehensive quality control system for cardboard inspection using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Measurement Systems for Control Applications** course at Politecnico di Milano.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This system performs automated quality control inspection of cardboard pieces through two main analysis modules:

1. **Contour Quality Check**: Analyzes cardboard contours, vertices, and internal cuts against golden samples
2. **Surface Defect Detection**: AI-powered surface defect detection using Few-Shot Learning with Vision Transformers

## âœ¨ Features

### Contour Analysis
- Real-time cardboard contour detection
- Vertex detection based on slope changes
- Internal cut/hole analysis
- Shape comparison with golden samples
- Defect localization and classification

### Surface Defect Detection
- Few-Shot Learning with Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Prototypical Networks for classification
- Real-time inference with confidence scores
- Synthetic defect generation for training augmentation
- Data augmentation with geometric and photometric transformations

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Contour Check**: Navigate through test images and click "Analyze Contours"
2. **Surface Check**: Navigate through test images and click "Analyze Surface"
3. View detailed analysis results and visualizations
4. Check the "System Information" tab for model details

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **Architecture**: Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) + Prototypical Networks
- **Training**: Few-shot learning with data augmentation
